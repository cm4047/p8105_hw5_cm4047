# Problem 1

First, load the data.

``` r
homicide_data = 
        read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The raw data contains 12 columns and 52179 rows in total. The data
provides information of more than 52,000 criminal homicides over past
decades in 50 of the largest American cities. The data includes the
location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in most cases,
basic demographic information about each victim.

Then, clean the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
        homicide_data %>%
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        mutate(
                city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
                disposition = recode(disposition, "Closed without arrest" = "Unsolved"),
                disposition = recode(disposition, "Open/No arrest" = "Unsolved"),
                disposition = recode(disposition, "Closed by arrest" = "Solved")
        ) %>%
        select(city_state, disposition) %>% 
        filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
```

Obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved
homicides.

``` r
homicide_total = 
        homicide_df %>% 
        group_by(city_state) %>% 
        summarise(
                hom_total = n(),
                hom_unsolved = sum(disposition == "Unsolved")
        )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved in the city of
Baltimore, MD.

``` r
prop.test(
        homicide_total %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
        homicide_total %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
) %>%
        broom::tidy() %>% 
        select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

Estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved in all cities.

``` r
results_df = 
        homicide_total %>% 
        mutate(
                prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
                tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
        ) %>% 
        select(-prop_tests) %>% 
        unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
        select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Creat a plot.

``` r
results_df %>% 
        mutate(
                city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)
        ) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```
